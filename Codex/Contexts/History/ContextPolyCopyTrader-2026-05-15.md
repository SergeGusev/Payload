Проверь статус стратегий

Result:
Queried the server database at `192.168.0.101` read-only for strategy status. `PolyCopyTrader.Service` was running in `Live` mode with a fresh heartbeat and no heartbeat error; `1178` strategies existed, `1176` were enabled, `0` had `live_stakes=true`, `follow_leader` was disabled, and `BTC Up or Down 5m Statistics` was enabled with live stakes off. Overall Paper performance remained negative (`24188` settled, PnL `-20140.2655`, ROI `-29.7678%`), with only a few positive 100+ sample candidates led by `btc_up_down_5m_less_60_gamma`. The Statistics strategy was active (`36041` ticks, latest sample age about `3.5s`, `9202/9310` observations applied), but resolved first-per-market would-bets remained negative. Found that Gamma max-offset API errors are still being logged on the server, indicating the server process still needs the max-offset fix deployed/restarted.

Переделай Dashboard так, чтобы он определял доступность сервиса по базе, а не по пингу, иначе некорректно получается для удалённой базы

Result:
Changed Dashboard automatic refresh so the service banner and readiness rows derive service availability from the selected database's `service_heartbeats` row for `PolyCopyTrader.Service` instead of probing localhost IPC `/status`. Added a `ServiceAvailability` snapshot/evaluator with heartbeat age and stale detection, updated overview/diagnostics/live-readiness display, and documented that IPC remains only the command channel for control buttons. Verification passed: Dashboard Release build succeeded with a temporary output path, full tests passed 472/472, and `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only.

Проверь доступность базы нового сервера

Result:
Checked new-server PostgreSQL availability at `192.168.0.101:5432`. TCP connectivity succeeded, and a temporary C#/.NET/Npgsql read-only diagnostic using `POLYCOPYTRADER_POSTGRES_CONNECTION` with host overridden to `192.168.0.101` opened database `polycopytrader` in about `302 ms`. The database returned `74` public tables, `service_heartbeats` exists, and `PolyCopyTrader.Service` had a fresh `Running`/`Live` heartbeat from `2026-05-15T05:33:20Z` with age about `40.4s` and no last-error flag. The temporary diagnostic project was removed.

Посмотри картинку. Dashboard не может достучаться после последних изменений.

Result:
Extracted and inspected the screenshot from the Windows clipboard. The failure was not a service availability or PostgreSQL connection failure; Dashboard timed out while reading `GetStrategyRecentPerformanceAsync`. Rewrote that repository query to aggregate recent strategy metrics in batch CTEs instead of per-strategy/window lateral scans, added supporting schema indexes and storage schema assertions, and verified the optimized method against `192.168.0.101` returned `3534` rows in about `4500 ms`. Build and full tests passed; temporary diagnostic/build artifacts were removed.

Request:
На Dashboard, на каждом табе вкладки Strategies, возле дроп дауна выбора категорий, добавь чекбокс - Only positive, если он выделен - показываем только те записи, где Closed ROI > 0

Result:
Added an `Only positive` checkbox beside the category selector on each Dashboard `Strategies` tab: `All`, `24 hours`, `6 hours`, and `1 hour`. The `All` tab now filters rows by `ClosedRoiPct > 0`; the recent-window tabs filter by their window ROI (`RoiPct > 0`). Dashboard Release build passed with a temporary output path, full tests passed 472/472, and `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only.

Request:
На всех табах Strategies по часам - 24, 6, 1 - крайними слева сделай колонки Settles, Won, Lost, Realized, ClosedRoi. На All оставь как есть

Result:
Updated the shared Dashboard hourly strategy grid template used by the `24 hours`, `6 hours`, and `1 hour` tabs so the far-left columns are now `Settles`, `Won`, `Lost`, `Realized`, and `ClosedRoi`. The `All` strategy tab was left unchanged. Dashboard Release build passed with a temporary output path, full tests passed 472/472, and `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only.

Request:
В последней задаче я погорячился. Самой левой колонкой оставь всё-таки название стратегия

Result:
Adjusted the shared Dashboard hourly strategy grid template so `Name` is again the far-left column on the `24 hours`, `6 hours`, and `1 hour` strategy tabs. The result columns remain immediately after it: `Settles`, `Won`, `Lost`, `Realized`, and `ClosedRoi`. Dashboard Release build passed with a temporary output path, full tests passed 472/472, and `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only.

Объясни такое маленькое количество Settled транзакций стратегии BTC Up or Down 1h PreOpen Full Down 49. За сутки только 6. Я рассчитывал на 24

Result:
Investigated the exact strategy with a temporary read-only C#/.NET/Npgsql diagnostic against remote PostgreSQL `192.168.0.101`. The low settlement count is due to passive maker-style GTD limit behavior, not missing hourly markets: the exact strategy created 24 orders in the last 24h, but only 11 newly created orders filled, 12 expired without fills and were marked `Skipped/gtd_limit_not_filled`, and 1 was still pending. Dashboard's 24h `Settles` is counted by `settled_at_utc`; at the check time the remote DB showed 12 Dashboard-window settlements for the exact strategy and 10 for the similar `... Down 49 Sell` strategy. The temporary diagnostic project was removed; no production code changed.

Request:
Clarify whether the past-day markets really did not go below `0.49`; the user doubted that only 10/11 fills was realistic.

Result:
Rechecked the exact strategy with a temporary read-only C#/.NET/Npgsql diagnostic against remote PostgreSQL `192.168.0.101`. The database does not contain full persisted tick/order-book history for those order windows: matching `order_book_snapshots`, `polymarket_websocket_trade_ticks`, and `polymarket_onchain_trade_captures` rows were absent for the Down asset ids, so DB history cannot prove the exact intraday minimum for every market. However, the order `raw_decision_json` initial CLOB snapshots directly showed that the market did reach the strategy limit at submission time: among 24 orders, 9 had initial best ask `<= 0.49`, 8 had initial best ask `< 0.49`, the minimum initial best ask was `0.47`, and the minimum initial last trade was `0.44`. Several orders still expired with `gtd_limit_not_filled` despite executable initial ask depth, while filled orders had `BalancedGtcDepth` evidence. This points to a paper-fill simulation/processing/version issue rather than the market never touching `0.49`. The temporary diagnostic project was removed; no production code changed.

Разберись с " Это похоже на проблему в paper-fill simulation/processing или на то, что сервер фактически не применяет
  текущую conservative GTD fill логику", это действительно похоже на проблему.

Result:
Found and fixed the concrete fill-model recognition bug. PreOpen opening-limit orders are created with `pricing_mode = "paper_gtd_limit"`, but `ConservativePaperGtdFillEstimator` only recognized `"opening_limit"` and a legacy conversion flag, so current BTC PreOpen GTD orders bypassed the conservative fill path and only filled when the later ordinary `BalancedGtcDepth` check happened to cross the limit. Updated the estimator to recognize `paper_gtd_limit`, added a direct unit test for that mode, and added an integration test proving `PaperTradingProcessor` fills from `paper_gtd_initial_executable_ask_shares` even when the current book no longer crosses the limit. Verification passed: targeted tests 7/7, full tests 474/474, Service Release build passed, and `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only. The remote service still needs deploy/restart to apply the fix; old expired orders will not be retroactively filled.

Request:
Это будет касаться всех стратегий или только BTC Up or Down 1h PreOpen Full Down 49 ?

Result:
Answered from current code inspection that the fix is not limited to `BTC Up or Down 1h PreOpen Full Down 49`. `ConservativePaperGtdFillEstimator` applies to BTC strategy ids in `StrategyIds.BtcUpDown5mVariants` when an order is BUY, GTD, opening-limit Paper, conservative GTD fills are enabled, and the raw decision JSON contains a supported opening-limit mode such as `paper_gtd_limit`. This covers all current BTC Up/Down variants that create such opening-limit orders, while excluding FollowLeader, non-BTC strategies, SELL orders, live shadow test orders, and non-GTD/non-opening-limit orders. No source code changed.

Ты можешь графически показать работу стратегии Statistics? Мне надо понять, насколько вычисляемые им вероятности близки к курсу BTC и рынку Polymarket. Например, масшабированный график с тремя линиями

Result:
Generated a local graphical report at `artifacts/statistics-visual-report.html` using a one-off C#/.NET/Npgsql read-only generator under `artifacts/statistics-visual-report`. The report reads remote PostgreSQL `192.168.0.101` and renders inline SVG charts for the latest 8 BTC 5-minute Statistics markets. Each chart has three lines: Statistics Up probability, Polymarket Up price used by the strategy, and BTC price min-max scaled to `0..1` inside that market window; black dots show would-bet ticks. The summary table includes model-vs-market MAE and correlations. On the generated sample, recent model-vs-market MAE ranged about `14.5%` to `21.9%`. No production code changed; the generated report and generator remain local untracked artifacts.

Такие расхождения определяются малым количеством точек для статистики? Я ожидал большей похожести

Result:
Ran a temporary read-only C#/.NET/Npgsql diagnostic against remote PostgreSQL `192.168.0.101` and removed it afterward. Sparse historical support is a major reason for the visible divergence: over the last 8h, comparable Statistics ticks had median `effective_count` about `5.22`, while the actionable threshold is `20`; `20009` of `20688` comparable ticks were in the `<20` bucket. The underlying `btc_5m_history` grid is sparse too: `306138` cells, `1149723` total observations, median cell count `2`, p90 `8`, max `9545`. Higher-support points were closer but still not market-identical: `effective_count >= 500` had Up model-vs-market MAE about `0.1195` versus overall Up MAE about `0.1752`. Also noted that the visual report compared the model to the strategy's selected market price, usually best ask, not Polymarket mid/fair probability, so spread and liquidity inflate the difference.
